<title>Indented Paragraphs with &nbsp;</title>
</head>
<body>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the first paragraph. I am using multiple non-breaking spaces (`&amp;nbsp;`) at the beginning to create a visual indentation. While this technically achieves a form of indentation, it's not considered good practice for proper web development. CSS is the method for styling.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the second paragraph, also "indented" using several non-breaking spaces. For consistent and maintainable styling on the web, you would typically use CSS properties like `text-indent` or `padding-left` on the `<p>`element.</p>
